I am a game and software developer with a BA degree in Visual and Game Programming from the Art Institute of Phoenix. I also have a degree in Electro-Engineering from Gilde Opleidingen in the Netherlands but my passion for programming and gaming goes back much further than my college experience. For over 10 years I have been programming in one form or another and for over 20 years I have been playing video games. To me that is an ideal marriage of problem solving and fun! Using my development knowledge, curiosity and dedication I hope to add my own innovative touch to the world of video games.
